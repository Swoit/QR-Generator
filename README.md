# Cafe Website with AI Assistant

This project provides a simple cafe website that includes:

- Sign up form which gives a custom offer.
- Basic AI chat assistant with rule based responses.
- Random item recommendations.
- QR Code generator page (`QR Code.html`) from the original project.

## Running

The server uses Node's built-in modules (no external dependencies).

```bash
node server.js
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.
